### 💡 Tip for You:
When pasting this prompt in **Firebase Studio or Replit AI**, say:
> “Apply this design system strictly — especially fonts, colors, and animations — and use React + TailwindCSS to generate production-ready clean code.”

---

Would you like me to also generate a **matching Tailwind configuration file (`tailwind.config.js`)** and **`theme.css` palette file** so that the Firebase project looks pixel-perfect from the start?
